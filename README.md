# What_the_cell (Nena's attempt to play with Markdown) 
## To do's 
### 1. <ins>Identify internal in-house generated scRNA-seq datasets of the mouse nervous system</ins>
 * Rosi Lab: TBI 1dpi (single nuc) _have to ask Kristof the link_
 * Rosi Lab: [TBI 7dpi (single nuc)](https://rstudio.lab.altoslabs.com/content/3397a14a-18ba-4195-959a-ae6e0a12fbfe/) 
 * ?Costa Mattioli Lab: ISR _have to ask Kristof the link_

### 2. <ins>Identify external publicly available scRNA-seq datasets of the mouse nervous system of interest to the Altos mission</ins>

 **Catalog idea** (_Sarah feel free to play around_): 
  * [link to reference paper]
  * Species/Organism
  * Strain
  * Organ
  * Single Cell/Single Nuc/Omics
  * Sex
  * Age range
  * Perturbation if any

Example
  * [Hahn et al., 2023]
  * Mus Musculus
  * C57BL/6JN
  * Brain, anterior hippocampus and caudate putamen
  * Single Nuc seq + Spatial seq
  * Males and Females
  * 3, 12, 15, 18, and 21 months (males and females) 26, 28 months (only males)
  * acute dietary restriction (aDR)and injections of young mouse plasma (YMP) in 19mo mice


### 3. <ins>Identify additional cell atlases with scRNA-seq data that you believe are high-quality and of high-impact for Altos</ins>
